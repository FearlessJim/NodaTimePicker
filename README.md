# BlazorNodaTimeDateTimePicker
A Date/Time picker for [Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor), using [NodaTime](https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime).

This project aims to develop Date/Time picker components in Blazor, using NodaTime as the main dependency for Date and Time calculations.

It is inspired by the very successful Javascript Date/Time picker developed by [TempusDominus](https://github.com/tempusdominus/bootstrap-4).

## Todo
- SASS - remove all dependencies on Bootstrap and Tempusdominus (TD)
- Implement all current sensible functionality that TD currently implements (events, properties, UI)

## Help Wanted!
Get in touch if you want to collaborate!!

## In an ideal world...
- Date picker
- Time picker
- Date+Time picker
- Date range picker
- Date+Time range picker
- Month picker
- Year picker
- Support for different calendars
