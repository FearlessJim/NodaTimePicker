# BlazorNodaTimeDateTimePicker
A Date/Time picker for [Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor), using [NodaTime](https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime).

This project aims to develop Date/Time picker components in Blazor, using NodaTime as the main dependency for Date and Time calculations.

It is inspired by the very successful Javascript Date/Time picker developed by [TempusDominus](https://github.com/tempusdominus/bootstrap-4).
